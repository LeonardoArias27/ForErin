        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hi Erin, I am creating this blog as a way to communicate many of the thoughts and ideas that come to my mind for you. 

		Most of them are spontaneous, while others have been with me since the moment we met and started to interact. 

		I believe a blog is a beautiful way to share these ideas with you, as it allows me to focus on writing and clearly 
		describing my thoughts for your enjoyment and understanding. 
		
		This helps create a new way of communicating between us, which I believe is essential in overcoming the challenge of 
		getting to know someone who is far away.</p>
		
		<p>I will keep you updated on my projects and what is happening in my life as a way to share more of myself with you, 
		so you can occasionally know about the challenges I'm facing ðŸ˜‰.</p>

		
		<p>I plan to create new posts regularly, so feel free to check back here from time to time; you might notice some changes, like change in references, 
		some info added or maybe a new image would pop up.
		
		The website is optimized for mobile viewing, so the display and layout will be better on your phone than on a laptop. 
		The wonderful aspects is that youâ€™ll be able to read my ideas for you anytime and as often as you like. In the meantime, 
		you can take a look at the first post Iâ€™ve already written for you. Iâ€™ll inform you about future entries when theyâ€™re ready ðŸ˜Š. </p>
