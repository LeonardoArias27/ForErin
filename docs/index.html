        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hi Erin, I am creating this blog as a way to communicate many of the thoughts and ideas that come to my mind for you. 

		Most of them are spontaneous, while others have been with me since the moment we met and started to interact. 

		I believe a blog is a beautiful way to share these ideas with you, as it allows me to focus on writing and clearly 
		describing my thoughts for your enjoyment and understanding. 
		
		This helps create a new way of communicating between us, which I believe is essential in overcoming the challenge of 
		getting to know someone who is far away.</p>
		
		<p>I will create new post on a regular basis, so you can check eventually this place maybe you will notice notice some changes.
		Although, I will let you know when something important happens here. The website is optimized to be
		read in your phone, so the display and visualization will be better here than in a notebook. 
		The beatiful thing is that here, you will be able to read my ideas for you at any time you want and as much as you want. 
		Meanwhile, you can have a look to the first post I already wrote for you. 
		I will inform you of future entries when they are ready ðŸ˜Š. </p>
