        <h2>About</h2>
        <p> Hi Erin, I am creating this blog as a way to communicate many of the thoughts and ideas that come to my mind for you. 

		Most of them are spontaneous, while others have been with me since the very moment we met. 

		I believe a blog is a beautiful way to share these ideas with you, as it allows me to focus on writing and clearly 
		describing my thoughts for your enjoyment and deeper understanding of my intentions and my person. 
		
		This helps to create a new way of dialogue between us, which I believe is essential in overcoming the challenge of 
		getting to know someone who is in the distance.</p>
		
		<p>I will keep you updated on my projects and what is happening in my life, so you can occasionally know about the challenges 
		I'm facing ðŸ˜‰, laugh a bit with the nonesenses I write here or give me some advice and feedbackm which I would love.</p>

		
		<p>This is my way of showing you my interest and what I meant when I told you I would write you substantially, in order to avoid
		empty space between us and consistently know each other a bit more.
		I plan to create new posts regularly, so feel free to check back here from time to time; you might notice slight changes, some info added 
		or maybe a new image would pop up. But Iâ€™ll inform you about future entries when theyâ€™re ready ðŸ˜Š anyways. 
		
		The website is optimized for mobile viewing, so the display and layout will be better on your phone than on a laptop. 
		The wonderful aspects is that youâ€™ll be able to read my ideas for you anytime and as often as you like. In the meantime, 
		you can take a look at the first post Iâ€™ve already written for you. </p>
